TwilightVania
It is a single player platformer game that takes place in an alien forest at twilight. The goal of the main character Bluemi (blue and black skin) is to overcome all the obstacles, such as strikes, water, etc, and play around with any gears or triggers (lever and button), to open the gate to the exit.

The game has 3 main levels and 1 introductory level (just straight to the exit to go into the first level). The goals of them are all to escape through the exit. 

To control the player, use the key W A D to move and jump, SPACE to shoot, T to turn the lever… 
You might meet some enemies (worm, goblin, trunk), but don’t worry, the cute mushrooms are there to help you jump higher! 

Game Tips: 
- Don’t push the box too far until it collides with the wall, because you would not be able to drag it back (it’s too heavy isn’t it?)
- The enemies would speed up when they see you, so be careful! But sometimes they can’t control their speed and run out of the platform(suicide).  Also, they can turn the lever at some point…
- At level 3, if you fly to the top tunnel when you touch the Blood Flask, don’t worry, that is what is supposed to happen!

Please enjoy the game!
